# AI Search Algorithms (CS50 AI)

## Overview
This repository contains implementations and experiments with classical artificial intelligence search algorithms, developed as part of the self-directed study of **Harvard CS50’s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python**.

The focus of this repository is to understand how different search strategies operate, compare their performance, and analyze their suitability for various problem environments.

---

## Topics Covered
The following search concepts and algorithms are explored:

- State-space representation
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
- A* Search
- Heuristic design and evaluation
- Performance metrics (path length, nodes explored)

## Projects

### Maze Solver
A grid-based maze environment used to study classical search algorithms.  
This project compares uninformed and informed search strategies using identical problem settings to evaluate efficiency and optimality.

Implemented algorithms include:
- Depth-First Search
- Breadth-First Search
- Uniform Cost Search
- A* Search with multiple heuristics

---

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Understanding how search problems are formulated in AI
- Recognizing trade-offs between completeness, optimality, time, and space complexity
- Observing how heuristic quality impacts A* search performance
- Gaining experience in benchmarking and analyzing algorithmic behavior

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Python 3
- Standard Python libraries only (no external ML frameworks)

---

## Academic Integrity & Attribution
Portions of the codebase are adapted from the **starter code provided in Harvard CS50’s “Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python”**.  
All extensions, experiments, and analyses were implemented independently for learning and exploration purposes.

This repository is intended for educational use only.
